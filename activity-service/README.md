# Activity Service

## Overview

The `activity-service` is a critical component of the e-learning platform, designed to track and log user activities across various modules. This service provides insights into user behavior, course engagement, and overall platform usage, helping to drive data-driven decisions to enhance the learning experience.

## Features

### 1. User Activity Tracking
- **Course Access**: Logs when a user starts, continues, or completes a course.
- **Module Progress**: Tracks user progress on individual course modules, including time spent on each module.
- **Content Interaction**: Records interactions with course content such as videos watched, materials downloaded, and quizzes attempted.
- **Login/Logout Events**: Captures user login and logout events to monitor session durations and frequency.

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Message Queue Integration**: Integrates with a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous event processing.
- **Microservices Communication**: Listens to events from other microservices like `course-service`, `user-service`, and `enrollment-service`.

### 3. Activity Aggregation
- **Daily/Weekly Reports**: Aggregates activity data to generate daily or weekly reports on user engagement.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Implements real-time monitoring and analytics of user activities.

### 4. Data Storage and Query Optimization
- **Efficient Storage**: Utilizes a time-series database or document store to efficiently log and query activity data.
- **Indexing**: Implements indexing strategies to optimize query performance.

### 5. User Engagement Metrics
- **Engagement Scores**: Calculates user engagement scores based on activity metrics.
- **Gamification Integration**: Tracks activities related to gamification, such as points earned and badges unlocked.

### 6. Data Privacy and Security
- **Anonymization**: Anonymizes data to protect user privacy.
- **Access Control**: Restricts access to activity logs with role-based access control (RBAC).

### 7. APIs for Reporting and Analytics
- **Activity Logs API**: Provides APIs to query user activity logs.
- **Insights and Trends API**: Offers APIs to access insights and trends based on aggregated data.

### 8. Notifications and Alerts
- **User Notifications**: Triggers notifications based on specific activities, such as course completion reminders.
- **Admin Alerts**: Sends alerts to admins based on unusual activity patterns.

### 9. Integration with Machine Learning
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict user behavior, such as dropout risk.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests courses or content to users based on their activity data.

### 10. Scalability and Performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Supports horizontal scaling to handle large volumes of activity data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitors and optimizes service performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Kafka/RabbitMQ (for message queue integration)
- MongoDB/InfluxDB (for data storage)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/activity-service.git
   cd activity-service

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install


1. **Configure the application:**
   ```bash
   Update the application.yml or configure it via Spring Cloud Config.
Set up Kafka/RabbitMQ connection settings.
Configure the database connection (MongoDB/InfluxDB).

1. **Run the service:**
